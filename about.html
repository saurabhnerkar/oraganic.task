           <p> <h1> Values Statement</h1>  

                    
        <p><b>Our Mission: </b> Organic Farming Research Foundation works to foster the improvement and widespread adoption of organic farming systems. OFRF cultivates organic research, education, and federal policies that bring more farmers and acreage into organic production. <br><br>

 <b> Our Vision:</b> Organic farming as the leading form of agriculture, supporting healthy and resilient people, ecosystems, and economies.
 </p>
     </div>



  <div class="paragraph"> <h1>We listen and respond to the needs of organic producers.</h1>
<p>We are dedicated to ensuring that the input and perspectives of farmers are at the cornerstone of our work. As stewards of the land, organic producers know first-hand the challenges and opportunities that exist. By regularly listening to and engaging with organic farmers and ranchers about their most pressing needs, we are able to understand their challenges and address them in timely and impactful ways.

     </div>


     <div class="paragraph">
     <h1>We are science-based.
The information we distribute and the projects we support are rooted in science. We invest in innovative research to get novel ideas off the ground that might not otherwise be funded. We are not membership-driven or led by special interests.</h1>

<p>We support an interdisciplinary, systems-based approach to agricultural sustainability.
By emphasizing a strong integration of practices, perspectives, and cultures that work in harmony with nature, we work to create a more resilient and equitable farm and food system. We recognize and value traditional ecological knowledge and the enduring wisdom of generations of land and food stewards.
     </p>
</div>
 <div class="paragraph">
<h1>We recognize healthy, living soil as the foundation of sustainable and successful farming.</h1>

<p>Soil is life. Healthy soils form the foundation of organic production, sustain crops through dry spells, require less irrigation water, and undergo less ponding, runoff, and erosion during heavy rains. We provide research and education that supports farmers’ ability to protect and improve soil health.</p>
</div>
   <div class="paragraph"> 

<h1>We advance organic agriculture as a solution to climate change.
Climate change endangers the soil, water, and every natural resource on which food production depends, posing critical risks for farmers and ranchers, and impacting low income communities and people of color disproportionately.</h1>



<p>We work to scale-up the benefits of organic systems to reduce agriculture’s contribution to climate change and increase resilience in our food and farming systems.

We strive to understand all of the impacts and opportunities in agriculture to ensure a diverse and equitable food system that benefits everyone.
We value collaborative and community driven approaches and work to increase the diversity of people, ideas, and points of view in our farming and food systems. We are committed to helping dismantle the structural racism in our food and farming system.
